# Taskman

### This is the frontend of a task management system for a field team.
### The system allows the admin to create and assign new tasks to team members and team members are able to login and see tasks assigned to them
### Anytime a task is assigned to a team member, they get notified in their emails and a reminder is sent a day before the deadline of the task
